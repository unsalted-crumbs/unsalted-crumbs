I am open to any compliments and such!! if i dont reply to your its either a crown or i am non verbal!!
C+H is fine unless my skin says dnt.
If my skin does say dnt, please take it seriously!! This is controversal but i really dont like when people touch/cover my skin after i've worked hard to make it.
